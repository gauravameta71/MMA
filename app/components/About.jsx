        Khabib Nurmagomedov is a retired mixed martial artist who is widely
        regarded as one of the greatest fighters in the history of the sport. He
        was born on September 20, 1988, in Sildi, Dagestan, Russia. Khabib is of
        Avar descent and comes from a family with a strong background in
        wrestling. Throughout his MMA career, Khabib competed in the lightweight
        division and amassed an undefeated record, retiring with a perfect 29-0
        record. He was known for his exceptional grappling skills, particularly
        in Sambo and Judo, as well as his suffocating ground control and
        relentless pressure. Khabib gained international recognition as a
        dominant force in the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship), where he
        captured the UFC Lightweight Championship. His fighting style combined
        with his humble demeanor outside of the octagon earned him a large and
        dedicated fan base.
